# The Unreal Engine template project for the UMG/Slate Compendium
An Unreal Template project thats associated with the UMG/Slate Compendium for sharing specific code snippets and features as an open source project. Updated at my own leasure(or by the community if you want to help :D ).

Currently in Unreal Engine 5.2
This is a C++ project, so make sure you can open a template C++ project from Visual Studio before trying to open this(to make sure you have the necessary tooling). This project doesn't do anything special and uses standard Unreal Engine API's with no real custom code so if a template C++ project can be opened from Visual Studio then this project is able to opened, when creating a template project Unreal Engine will automatically open the compiled project this is not what I am referring to when I say "open from Visual Studio". You can also open it from Rider(recommended if you are experienced with programming). The best test case is always the Third Person Template Project.
